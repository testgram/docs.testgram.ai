## Install
Run the following command in your project directory to install this module.
```bash
tg install testgram/broken_link
```

## Description
This module listens for any`<a>` tags that get created or modified during the application runtime and ensures that they
do not respond back with a status code of [`404`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404) or [`405`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/405)
(essentially making sure the resource resolves and the link is not broken).

### Implementation
import Gist from 'react-gist';
