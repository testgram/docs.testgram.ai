## Install
Run the following command in your project directory to install this module.
```bash
tg install testgram/text_overflow
```

## Description
This module watches the page for elements that contain text that flows outside of its containing element.

At its most basic level, this module listens for DOM mutations, including character data mutations, and emits an event
if it ever detects a text flowing outside of its container dimensions.

This is often a problem when testing responsive applications or when implementing i18n internationalization standards with
some languages requiring significantly more space to render.

### Implementation
import Gist from 'react-gist';
