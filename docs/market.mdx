# ðŸ›– The Testgram Market

**Use one of our community modules to refine the issues Testgram uncovers for you.**

## What is the Testgram Market?
The Testgram market is a collection of community defined modules that listen for specific
types of events or situations that occur across web applications.

When these events occur, the modules emit an [event](event/event) that's logged,
can be replayed, and then debugged.

## Jumpstart your testing
Software engineers frequently modularize code and build them into libraries.
These shareable libraries help developers operate smarter and with more efficiency:
they can spend more time focusing on their unique business logic,
and less time implementing code that someone else has already spent the time perfecting.

Testgram's modules are so powerful because so many of the reoccuring
testing problems we encountered are shared across organizations, for example:
* [detecting broken links](market/broken_link)
* [detecting Javascript errors](market/jserror)
* [detecting when text flows outside of it's container bounding box](market/text_overflow)
* detecting when a video's frame rate falls below a threshold
* detecting broken or failing APIs responses with 404 or 5xx series status codes
* ... and much more!

These modules can be general (like the JS error module) or niche (like detecting a slow video frame rate).

**In the end, you're always in control over what Testgram captures.**
