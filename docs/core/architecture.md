# Architecture

THIS PAGE IS STILL A WIP

**The goal of testing is to build confidence by creating methods of early detection**; 
the earlier we can detect important issues, the faster we can fix them and prevent them from affecting (more of) our users. 
It helps us build faster, build better, and build stronger products.

On the other hand today, web applications have become really complex. That means that there are also many more ways to break them.
This makes it really hard to test them well.

Testgram was built from the ground up to help us test the modern web. 
At Testgram, we often talk about taking a blank slate, first principles approach to web testing. Hereâ€™s what we mean.

## Guiding Principles

### Testgram gets better with time and usage.
Traditional testing approaches often get worse with time and change. 
Tests are often written with a certain snapshot of the application in mind. 
As the application changes, traditional tests break, and as developers we have to keep chasing our tails. 

Testgram is built with change in mind, 

At the most basic level, we often struggle with getting the browser spun up, building good (non-flaky) selectors, 

### Testgram get's the little things right, so you can focus on the big stuff.
We witnessed compounding fractures starting at the lowest levels of web testing.
