# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Testgram

At its core, Testgram is an **AI enabled, web-testing** platform that helps you **build and deploy scalable user simulations**. 
These simulations helps you answer one simple question: **"Will the code I wrote today affect my users tomorrow?"**.

The goal of these simulations is to help you *quickly* test your application in all the ways that itâ€™s really used by users 
**without having to author, manage, or maintain specific test cases**. Itâ€™s built to address the key pain points we noticed developers have around web testing.

If you are new here, you should check out our:
* [Getting Started Tutorial](getting-started/tutorial)
* [Installation Guide](getting-started/install)
* [Core Concepts](core/concepts)

## Who uses Testgram?
Our users are typically developers or QA engineers building web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks.

## Will Testgram work for me? 
Testgram learns from user interactions on the browser and simulates on the browser too. 
If your application runs on the browser, there's a good chance Testgram will work for you.
Testgram supports 30+ frameworks including Angular, React, Vue, Next.js, Angular.js, JQuery and Ember. 

## Where does Testgram run?
A fundamental goal of testing is early detection. 
Testgram is built to run early and often in your workflow: starting on your local machine, CI pipelines, 
intermediate QA/staging environments, or really, *anywhere*.
