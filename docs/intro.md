# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Testgram 

Testgram at its core is an AI-enabled web-testing framework that helps you **build and deploy scalable simulations** in pre-production environments. 
The goal of these simulations is to help you **quickly** test your application in all the ways that itâ€™s really used **without** having to author, manage, or maintain specific test cases. 
Itâ€™s built to address some of the key pain points around web testing. 

Another helpful way to think about Testgram is to imagine the tools we use to monitor events and issues in production: Sentry, DataDog, Splunk, etc. 
Testgram helps you find, capture, and debug these types of events before they ever reach production.

## Who uses Testgram?
Our users are typically developers or QA engineers building web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks.

## Will Testgram work for me? 
Testgram learns from user interactions on the browser, and simulates on the browser too. 
If your application runs on the browser, there's a good chance Testgram will work for you.
Testgram supports 30+ frameworks including Angular, React, Vue, Next.js, Angular.js, JQuery and Ember. 

## Where does Testgram run?
A fundamental goal of testing is early detection. Testgram is built to run early and often in your workflow: starting on your local machine, CI pipelines, and intermediate QA environments.
