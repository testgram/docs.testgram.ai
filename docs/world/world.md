# World

A **World** is your application. We continuously collect data about how people are using your application to build a map of your World.

Your World naturally changes over time as new pages, APIs, or elements get introduced.
Testgram keeps up with your World through the data it collects.

## The Components of World 
A World is natural grouping of all the data, Players, and team members necessary to test **one** application.
A World has: 
* **Data:** Each environment/URL where your application is deployed is part of the same World. 
  Testgram will learn from any combination (or all) of the environments you allow.
* **Players:** The Players you create will also be part of that World. 
  The data you collect through usage on your environments will be used to run your Players.
* **Team Members:** Your team members are also a part of your World. 
  Each team member can take advantage of the Players and data collected for a particular world.
