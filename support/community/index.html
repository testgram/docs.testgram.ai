So what does that look like?</p><p>This is a tight-knit community that lives on slack that enables an open forum for questions, feedback and discussion around all things testing.</p><p>This is underlying confidence that if you have a question or concern, an engineer that has dealt with similar problems is always there to help.</p><p>We’ve created a list of tips to help get the most out of the community:</p><p>#Tip 1: Search before posting</p><p>Seems like an obvious statement, but asking the community for help right off the bat restricts the ability for you to learn from the problem in an actionable way. Cheat sheets for practice homework are convenient, until the day of the test arrives… </p><p>A few good ways to push yourself to learn without asking for an answer to a specific issue:</p><p><em>Use the docs. These will continue to grow as our understanding of the product and user grows, but from the jump, many of the high level answers you are looking for will live here.
</em>Search the existing slack conversations. Maybe you find the exact problem, maybe you find something similar, there’s likely to be some crossover from other conversations that you can apply to what you’re hoping to achieve.
*Google! Testgram will live in many places, whether it&#x27;s youtube, stack overflow, reddit, and more. Always check to see if other people have addressed the issue in a different forum.</p><p>#Tip 2: Get to know the slack channels
We have a few different channels on Testgram Slack, and it helps us help you if your question is in the right channel!
#advice-tg-for-users: The hub for Testgram users just getting started! The default space to ask questions and get answers from other users(once you’ve already tried to solve the problem yourself). Keep an eye out for questions you might have solved yourself - jump in add your two cents to the conversation!</p><p>#product-feedback: Leave feedback for the Testgram team regarding your product experience.  As expressed earlier, Testgram is a product built for the community, inspired by the community. We rely on your feedback to keep making the product better for our users.</p><p>#product- releases: New release announcements! Hooray! (Testgram team posts only)</p><p>#tg-announcements: Community-wide announcements and discussion.  (Testgram team posts only)</p><p>#community-showcase:Celebrate personal projects, company milestones, or products that inspire you. (hint: make the post engaging so people will want to check it out!)</p><p>#memes-and-off-topic-chatter: A place to spread your off-topic creative wings! Keep it PG, but let your colors fly. Got a dank meme? Drop it here! How about a hilarious article you can’t keep to yourself? This is the spot!</p><p>You can anticipate questions to be unblocked within a few business hours by either a community member or a Testgram team member. If you have some suggestions for our slack process, please drop it in #product-feedback</p><p>#Tip 3: Be clear and actionable with your questions
##Share the context of the problem you’re trying to solve</p><p>The more refined the ask, the easier it will be to understand and answer. One good way to pressure test this is to re-read your question from a fresh-perspective POV (as though you have very little understanding of the specific issue or even the product as a whole). By bringing it down to its most basic, step-by-step cadence, you broaden the potential audience that can help you get unblocked.</p><p><em>Whenever possible, share the exact code you are trying to run, and the problem you are seeing (error message, or lack there-of).
</em>If the problem is codeless, create a step by walk-back of the implementation you are looking to execute.
*If the information you wish to get help with is security sensitive, try to get your question/overview as close to the real life scenario as possible, without compromising your work.</p><p>Often, you might have an issue that’s never been tested before, but you’d be surprised by the trouble shooting prowess of the Testgram.ai user base</p><p>#Stick to a formula that works
Familiarity leads to higher degrees of adoption and understanding, it’s science. With this in mind, keep your questions well structured, informative and actionable.
<em>Paste the error message or relevant code inside three backticks (&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;) in your question, instead of sharing a screenshot
</em>Breakdown what you’ve already attempted.
*Give us more details on your current setup
A suggested format:
“Hey TG Fam!</p><p>I’m running into the following issue:
(insert general issue)</p><p>Here’s what I’ve tried:
(insert relevant attempts)</p><p>Here are the specs:
<em>Language
</em>Version of Testgram
*Etc
Thanks!”</p><p>#Tip 4: Share your journey with other members of the community
##Always respond to comments of assistance
If someone tries to help you, comment back! Even if their exact suggestions didn’t help you move the needle, they spent time to try and unblock you, so close out the effort.</p><p>##Explore collaboration on projects.
You never know if you’re going to find your perfect paired programming match on the Testgram community slack channel. Don’t be afraid to reach out to someone that has been helpful and see if they would want to be a more active sounding board. But remember, it&#x27;s always better to ask, rather than just assume they would want to help you consistently and message them directly each time you have an issue.</p><p>##Create a window to your work and inspire others
You’ve harnessed the power of Testgram and the community, and you now have a kick-a** product that you’re super proud of. These are the moments that we built #community-showcase for</p><p>#Tip 5: Embrace proper Slack etiquette
##Be mindful of flooding Slack notifications
<em>Use threads as much as possible. They also make it easier to follow and manage the variety of conversations happening in here!
</em>Type your question out as one message rather than separate messages. I often find it useful to draft my message in a message to myself first!
<em>There’s no need to tag individuals when asking for help—we try our best to get to messages in a timely manner and share this responsibility between a few people.
</em>Do not directly message members of our community without their consent.
##Live the “Yes and… “ mentality</p><p>Try not to be a negative nancy. Nobody likes a negative nancy. Every perspective has value, foster a feeling of collective creativity when you’re interacting in the slack!</p><p>Happy Slacking!</p></div></article><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Community</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/testgram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/testgramai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">More</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://testgram.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Home</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2021 Testgram, Inc.</div></div></div></footer></div>
