So what does that look like?</p><p>This is a tight-knit community that lives on slack that enables an open forum for questions, feedback and discussion around all things testing.</p><p>This is underlying confidence that if you have a question or concern, an engineer that has dealt with similar problems is always there to help.</p><p>We’ve created a list of tips to help get the most out of the community:</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="tip-1-search-before-posting"></a>Tip 1: Search before posting<a class="hash-link" href="#tip-1-search-before-posting" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Seems like an obvious statement, but asking the community for help right off the bat restricts the ability for you to learn from the problem in an actionable way. Cheat sheets for practice homework are convenient, until the day of the test arrives…</p><p>A few good ways to push yourself to learn without asking for an answer to a specific issue:</p><p><em>Use the docs. These will continue to grow as our understanding of the product and user grows, but from the jump, many of the high level answers you are looking for will live here.
</em>Search the existing slack conversations. Maybe you find the exact problem, maybe you find something similar, there’s likely to be some crossover from other conversations that you can apply to what you’re hoping to achieve.
*Google! Testgram will live in many places, whether it&#x27;s youtube, stack overflow, reddit, and more. Always check to see if other people have addressed the issue in a different forum.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="tip-2-get-to-know-the-slack-channels"></a>Tip 2: Get to know the slack channels<a class="hash-link" href="#tip-2-get-to-know-the-slack-channels" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>We have a few different channels on Testgram Slack, and it helps us help you if your question is in the right channel!
#advice-tg-for-users: The hub for Testgram users just getting started! The default space to ask questions and get answers from other users(once you’ve already tried to solve the problem yourself). Keep an eye out for questions you might have solved yourself - jump in add your two cents to the conversation!</p><p>#product-feedback: Leave feedback for the Testgram team regarding your product experience.  As expressed earlier, Testgram is a product built for the community, inspired by the community. We rely on your feedback to keep making the product better for our users.</p><p>#product-releases: New release announcements! Hooray! (Testgram team posts only)</p><p>#tg-announcements: Community-wide announcements and discussion.  (Testgram team posts only)</p><p>#community-showcase:Celebrate personal projects, company milestones, or products that inspire you. (hint: make the post engaging so people will want to check it out!)</p><p>#memes-and-off-topic-chatter: A place to spread your off-topic creative wings! Keep it PG, but let your colors fly. Got a dank meme? Drop it here! How about a hilarious article you can’t keep to yourself? This is the spot!</p><p>You can anticipate questions to be unblocked within a few business hours by either a community member or a Testgram team member. If you have some suggestions for our slack process, please drop it in #product-feedback</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="tip-3-be-clear-and-actionable-with-your-questions"></a>Tip 3: Be clear and actionable with your questions<a class="hash-link" href="#tip-3-be-clear-and-actionable-with-your-questions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="share-the-context-of-the-problem-youre-trying-to-solve"></a>Share the context of the problem you’re trying to solve<a class="hash-link" href="#share-the-context-of-the-problem-youre-trying-to-solve" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The more refined the ask, the easier it will be to understand and answer. One good way to pressure test this is to re-read your question from a fresh-perspective POV (as though you have very little understanding of the specific issue or even the product as a whole). By bringing it down to its most basic, step-by-step cadence, you broaden the potential audience that can help you get unblocked.</p><p><em>Whenever possible, share the exact code you are trying to run, and the problem you are seeing (error message, or lack there-of).
</em>If the problem is codeless, create a step by walk-back of the implementation you are looking to execute.
*If the information you wish to get help with is security sensitive, try to get your question/overview as close to the real life scenario as possible, without compromising your work.</p><p>Often, you might have an issue that’s never been tested before, but you’d be surprised by the trouble shooting prowess of the Testgram.ai user base</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="stick-to-a-formula-that-works"></a>Stick to a formula that works<a class="hash-link" href="#stick-to-a-formula-that-works" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Familiarity leads to higher degrees of adoption and understanding, it’s science. With this in mind, keep your questions well structured, informative and actionable.
<em>Paste the error message or relevant code inside three backticks (&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;) in your question, instead of sharing a screenshot
</em>Breakdown what you’ve already attempted.
*Give us more details on your current setup
